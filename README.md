# 0SINTr

Welcome to the **0SINTr** project! This tool helps you set up a multi-agent OSINT AI system with ease, leveraging the flexible framework provided by crewAI. The goal is to enable agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and data analysis capabilities.

> **Note:** This tool is not designed for a full OSINT investigation but rather to build a foundation for the OSINT process by quickly creating a digital footprint of the target via advanced Google searches and breach data.

---

## Why 0SINTr?

The app directly interacts with high-quality APIs and services at a low cost, bypassing the need for unreliable third-party apps. This ensures you have full control over the code and only need to cover the API costs.

---

## Workflow

0SINTr performs two primary tasks:

### 1. Data Collection

You provide a **Username** or **Email Address** at the prompt. This is the **target** of the OSINT investigation. Ensure you create and populate a `.env` file as described below before running the tool.

**Automated tasks include:**
- Perform verbatim search, intext, inurl, and intitle search on Google.
- Store search results as JSON and remove duplicates.
- Scrape URLs from JSON and save each page as Markdown files in the `scraped` directory.
- Save unscreened pages (e.g., social media) in a `.txt` file.
- Save screenshots in the `screenshots` directory.
- Extract email addresses from scraped pages and store them in a `.txt` file.
- Check breaches and pastes for the account (username/email).
- Optionally use the OSINT.Industries API if an API key is provided.

### 2. Data Analysis

Once data is collected, the AI agents (crewAI) automatically analyze the information.

**Automated tasks include:**
- Analyze `.md`, `.json`, and other files in the target directory.
- AI agents work together, each with a specific goal, toolset, and output task.
- Remote models (e.g., GPT-4o) or local models (e.g., Llama3.1 via Ollama) can be used.
- Build a profile or digital footprint summary of the target based on collected data.
- The final report is generated by a Report Writer agent.

## API Keys

To use 0SINTr, you need the following API keys:

- **OpenAI**: [Get your key here](https://openai.com/)
- **SerperDev**: [Get your key here](https://serper.dev/)
- **Firecrawl**: [Get your key here](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)
- **HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP)**: [Get your key here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

Add these to your `.env` file in the root folder of 0SINTr.

---

## Optional Feature

Optionally, you can collect data from **OSINT.Industries** via their API. Add the key in `.env` as `OSIND_API_KEY=<your_key_here>`. This functionality is optional and triggered at runtime.

---

## Costs

- **OpenAI**: Pay-as-you-go; queries cost a few cents.
- **SerperDev**: 2,500 free queries, then pay-as-you-go (50k queries for $50).
- **Firecrawl**: 500 free credits; $19/mo for 3,000 page scrapes.
- **HIBP**: Pwned1 plan for $3.95/mo, 10 email searches/minute.

Expect a rough monthly cost of $23 for Firecrawl and HIBP, with variable OpenAI and SerperDev costs based on usage.

---

## Installation

Ensure Python >=3.10 is installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihpy/0SINTr.git
cd 0SINTr
python setup.py install
```

---

## Usage

```bash
main.py [-h] -t TARGET -a {remote,local} -o OUTPUT
```

---

## Customizing

Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and other API keys in the `.env` file:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
SERPER_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
HIBP_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
```

Customize tasks and outputs in `ai_logic/prompts.py` for agents and crew configuration.

---

## Running the Tool

To start the data collection and analysis process:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Understanding Your AI Crew

The OSINT Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles and tasks. Tasks are defined in `tasks.py`, and agent configurations are outlined in `agents.py`. Prompts for the crew are found in `prompts.py`.

---

## Planned Upgrades

- Support for additional LLMs (Claude, Phi-3, Mistral, Reflection)
- More data sources from quality API providers
- Phone number and company search capabilities
