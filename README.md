# 0SINTr

Welcome to the **0SINTr** project!  This tool helps you set up a multi-agent OSINT AI system with ease, leveraging the flexible framework provided by crewAI. The goal is to enable agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and data analysis capabilities.

> **Note:** This tool is not designed for a full OSINT investigation but rather to build a foundation for the OSINT process by quickly creating a digital footprint of the target via advanced Google searches, breach and paste data, and optional data sources.

---

## Why 0SINTr?

The app directly interacts with high-quality APIs and LLMs at a low cost, bypassing the need for unreliable third-party apps. This ensures you have full control over the code and only need to cover the API costs.

---

## Workflow

0SINTr performs two primary tasks:

### 1. Data Collection

You provide a **Username** or **Email Address** at the prompt. This is the **target** of the OSINT investigation. Ensure you create and populate a `.env` file as described below before running the tool.

**Automated tasks include:**
- Perform verbatim search, intext, inurl, and intitle search on Google.
- Store search results as JSON and remove duplicates.
- Scrape URLs from JSON and save each page as Markdown files in the `scraped` directory.
- Save unscreened pages (e.g., social media) in a `.txt` file.
- Save screenshots in the `screenshots` directory.
- Extract email addresses from scraped pages and store them in a `.txt` file.
- Check breaches and pastes for the account (username/email).
- Optionally use the OSINT.Industries API if an API key is provided.

### 2. Data Analysis

Once data is collected, the AI agents (crewAI) automatically analyze the information.

**Automated tasks include:**
- Analyze `.md`, `.json`, and other files in the target directory.
- AI agents work together, each with a specific goal, toolset, and output task.
- Default remote model is GPT-4o. Default local model is Llama3.1 via [Ollama](https://ollama.com).
- Using a local model is free, but you need decent+ hardware in most cases.
- For reference, using [llama3.1:70b](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) works decently on a i9 with 64GB RAM.
- If you lack hardware, use a smaller local model version (8b) or stick to remote.
- 0SINTr builds a profile or digital footprint of the target based on collected data.
- The final report is generated by a Report Writer agent in the target directory.

## API Keys

Running the **Data Analysis** phase via **remote** or **local** LLM depends on the items you enter into the `.env` file.
0SINTr automatically detects your `.env` settings and runs the AI crew accordingly.

**To use 0SINTr with a remote LLM such as GPT-4o, you need the following items in your `.env` file in the root folder of 0SINTr.**
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
SERPER_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
HIBP_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
``` 

**To use 0SINTr with a local LLM such as llama3.1, you need the following items in your `.env` file in the root folder of 0SINTr.** 
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=NA
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=llama3.1
SERPER_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
HIBP_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
```

**Note** that for llama3.1 you don't need an API key, but a placeholder for `OPENAI_API_KEY` (e.g. NA).

API Keys:
- **OpenAI**: [Get your key here](https://openai.com/)
- **SerperDev**: [Get your key here](https://serper.dev/)
- **Firecrawl**: [Get your key here](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)
- **HaveIBeenPwned**: [Get your key here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

## Optional Feature

Optionally, you can collect data from **OSINT.Industries** via their API. Add the key in `.env` as `OSIND_API_KEY=<your_key_here>`. This functionality is optional and triggered at runtime. [Pricing](https://www.osint.industries/pricing) starts at Â£19/mo. I made this optional because of costs.

---

## Costs

- **OpenAI**: Pay-as-you-go; queries cost a few cents.
- **SerperDev**: 2,500 free queries, then pay-as-you-go (50k queries for $50).
- **Firecrawl**: 500 free credits; $19/mo for 3,000 page scrapes. 
- **HIBP**: Pwned1 plan for $3.95/mo, 10 email searches/minute.

Expect a rough monthly cost of $23 for Firecrawl and HIBP, with variable OpenAI and SerperDev costs based on usage. Probably ~$50/mo for regular OSINT tasks. If you opt for the OSINT.Industries API too, costs jump to ~$100/mo. Speed, reliability and efficiency have a price.

---

## Installation

Ensure Python >=3.10 is installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihpy/0SINTr.git
cd 0SINTr
python setup.py install
```

---

## Usage

```bash
0sintr [-h] -t TARGET -o OUTPUT
```

---

## Understanding Your AI Crew

The OSINT crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles and tasks. Tasks are defined in `tasks.py`, and agent configurations are outlined in `agents.py`. Prompts for the crew are found in `prompts.py`.

---

## Planned Upgrades

- Support for additional LLMs (Claude, Phi-3, Mistral, Reflection)
- More data sources from quality API providers
- Phone number and company search capabilities
