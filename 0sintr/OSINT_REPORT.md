# OSINT Report

## Overview

This report compiles information from multiple data breaches involving email addresses and passwords. The data has been organized to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the breaches, including details such as the breach date, description, and a logo for visual reference.

## Breaches

### 1. Anti Public Combo List

- **Breach Date:** 2016-12-16
- **Description:** In December 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a "combo list" referred to as "Anti Public". The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for "credential stuffing", that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.

### 5. LinkedIn

- **Breach Date:** 2012-05-05
- **Description:** In May 2016, LinkedIn had 164 million email addresses and passwords exposed. Originally hacked in 2012, the data remained out of sight until being offered for sale on a dark market site 4 years later. The passwords in the breach were stored as SHA1 hashes without salt, the vast majority of which were quickly cracked in the days following the release of the data.

### 6. Not SOCRadar

- **Breach Date:** 2024-08-03
- **Description:** In August 2024, over 332M rows of email addresses were posted to a popular hacking forum. The post alleged the addresses were scraped from cybersecurity firm SOCRadar, however an investigation on their behalf concluded that "the actor merely utilised functionalities inherent in the platform's standard offerings, designed to gather information from publicly available sources". There is no suggestion the incident compromised SOCRadar's security or posed any risk to their customers.

### 7. Data Enrichment Exposure From PDL Customer

- **Breach Date:** 2019-10-16
- **Description:** In October 2019, security researchers Vinny Troia and Bob Diachenko identified an unprotected Elasticsearch server holding 1.2 billion records of personal data. The exposed data included an index indicating it was sourced from data enrichment company People Data Labs (PDL) and contained 622 million unique email addresses. The server was not owned by PDL and it's believed a customer failed to properly secure the database. Exposed information included email addresses, phone numbers, social media profiles and job history data.

## Conclusion

The breaches detailed in this report highlight the ongoing risks associated with the reuse of passwords across multiple online services. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to adopt strong, unique passwords for each service and consider the use of password managers to securely store these credentials. Additionally, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible can provide an extra layer of security against such credential stuffing attacks.
