google_analyst_task_description = '''
Search {directory} for .md files using the dir_tool. If there are no .md files in the directory, then tell me about it and do nothing.
For EACH .md file in {directory} read its contents using the MarkdownFileReaderTool, ignore and skip any characters or bytes you can't decode and read the rest of the file. 
Take the files in order and make sure you read each file only once.
Create the following empty lists in your memory. You're going to append data from each .md file to each of these lists.
- Email Addresses
- Usernames
- Aliases
- Main URLs
- Secondary URLs
- Locations

From EACH .md file:
- Extract all the email addresses you can find, then append them to the Email Addresses list.
- Extract all potential usernames you can find, then append them to the Usernames list.
- Extract all strings similar to {target} that might indicate aliases, including any forms of leetspeak, then append them to the Aliases list.
- Extract all URLs that are very likely directly related to {target}, then append them to the Main URLs list.
- Extract all the other URLs, append them to the Secondary URLs list.
- Extract all addresses, locations or coordinates, , append them to the Locations list.

Read the emailAddresses.txt file from the google directory under {top_directory} using the FileTool and add each email addresses from that file to the Email Addresses list.
Remove duplicates from each of the lists that you've just populated.
Once you finish going through ALL the .md files inside {directory}, stop.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.

hibp_analyst_task_description = '''
Search the leaks directory under {top_directory} for two JSON files named breaches.json and pastes.json using the dir_tool.
These two files contain information about data breaches and pastes where {target} was found.
For each of the two JSON files read its contents using the JSONFileReaderTool.
- Compile an organized list of all the breaches inside breaches.json, along with a brief context for each breach. Include only the Title, Breach Date, Description and Logo for each breach found.
- Compile an organized list of all the pastes inside pastes.json, along with a brief context for each breach. Include only the Source, Id and Date for each paste found.
Once you finish going through all the files inside the leaks directory and building the resulting dataset, make the lists available to the Curator.
If you don't find any data at all in both of these files, then your conclusion should be that {target} was not a victim of breaches or pastes.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.

Check if there's an osint_ind directory under {top_directory} using the dir_tool. If not, then tell me about it and do nothing.
If you find the osint_ind directory under {top_directory}, search for a JSON file named osind.json using the dir_tool.
Read the contents of osind.json using the JSONFileReaderTool and create a dictionary-like structure in your memory called OSINDDict.
For EACH entry from the osind.json file:
- Get the value of the 'schemaModule' key in OSINDDict and use it as a key of OSINDDict. If any duplicates occur, find out a clever way to keep all of them inside OSINDDict.
- Convert the value associated with the 'spec_format' key of each entry into a string, and associate it as a value to the corresponding 'schemaModule' key in OSINDDict.
- Extract all URLs, email addresses, locations, addresses, first names, last names or usernames residing in each value inside the OSINDDict dictionary.
- If you cannot find any relevant data nested under the 'spec_format' key, keep the respective 'schemaModule' key and assign it the value "Registered".
Make sure you go through all the entries in the osind.json files and not skip or abbreviate anything.
Once you finish going through the entire osind.json file and building the OSINDDict, make OSINDDict available to the Curator.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.

It is crucial to wait for the Google Data Analyst, the HIBP Data Analyst and the OSINT Industries Data Analyst to finish their tasks.
Collect the lists provided by the Google Data Analyst, the lists provided by the HIBP Data Analyst and OSINDDict provided by the OSINT Industries Data Analyst, and organize the information as follows:
- Introductory section about who the {target} and what are all the data sources that have been used by the Analysts.
- A section with all the information in the lists provided by the Google Data Analyst, structured and organized into relevant sub-sections.
- A section with all the information in the lists provided by the HIBP Data Analyst, structured and organized into relevant sub-sections.
- A section with all the information in the OSINDDict dataset provided by the OSINT Industries Data Analyst, structured and organized into relevant sub-sections.
- A section where you use your full data analysis capabilities and reasoning to look for connections between the data points, such as cross-referencing usernames across platforms, matching email addresses with possible profiles, and identifying recurring websites. You are capable of complex reasoning and reflection, so do your best to extract all meaningful data and add it to this section. If you detect that you made a mistake in your reasoning at any point, correct yourself before concluding your analysis.
- Final section containing a summary with conclusions and highlights about {target} based on your analysis and reasoning.
My job depends on the quality of your work, so do your best to provide an in-depth and coherent analysis, leaving no stone unturned.
Once you finish the entire task, use ALL the available data and compile a comprehensive and professional report in Markdown format.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.
