Search {directory} for .md files using the dir_tool. If there are no .md files in the directory, then tell me about it and do nothing.
For every .md file in {directory} read its contents using the md_tool and carefully analyze all the information about {target}.
Review and filter the data, discarding duplicates and irrelevant information, while focusing on actual intelligence related to {target}.
You are capable of complex reasoning and reflection, so do your best to extract meaningful data about {target} from each .md file.
Compile the results of your work into a well-organized dataset and pass them to the Curator for further analysis.
If you detect that you made a mistake in your reasoning at any point, correct yourself before concluding your analysis and tell me about it.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.

Search the leaks directory under {top_directory} for two JSON files named breaches.json and pastes.json using the dir_tool.
These two files contain information about data breaches and pastes where {target} was found.
For each of the two JSON files read its contents using the json_tool.
Compile an organized list of all the breaches inside breaches.json, along with a brief context for each breach.
Compile an organized list of all the pastes inside pastes.json, along with a brief context for each breach.
Compile the two lists into a well-organized dataset and pass it to the Curator for further analysis.
If you don't find any data at all in both of these files, then your conclusion should be that {target} was not a victim of breaches or pastes.
If necessary, identify any unclear parts or ambiguities in this task description so I can clear up any confusion.

Check if there's a osint_ind directory under {top_directory} using the dir_tool. If not, then tell me about it and do nothing.
If you find the osint_ind directory under {top_directory}, search for a JSON file named osind.json using the dir_tool.
Read the content of osind.json using the json_tool and carefully analyze all the information about {target}.
Review and filter the data, discarding duplicates and irrelevant information, while focusing on actual intelligence related to {target}.
For every entry in osind.json, make note of:

- The 'link' and/or 'image_url' and/or 'small_image_url' and/or 'profile_url' and/or 'picture_url' and/or 'photo' and/or 'image' values for every module, if any.
- The date and location for every review, rating, places, photos the user posted on Google.
You need to assemble all of this information and any other data you consider relevant about {target} from within osind.json.
You are capable of complex reasoning and reflection, so do your best to extract all meaningful data about {target} from the osind.json file.

Carefully analyze all the information, review and filter the data, discarding duplicates and irrelevant entries.
Cross-reference information to identify linked profiles, common usernames, or email associations of {target}.
From the data provided by the three Analysts, assemble a full list of websites, platforms, and online services where {target} has profiles or accounts.
In your analysis, include a comprehensive and well-organized list with any locations, maps, location reviews, ratings of places or geographical details to create a profile of {target}'s whereabouts.
Also compile a list of any data breaches or pastes where {target} was likely a victim of data leaks.
Highlight any patterns or connections in the data that suggest significant online activities or affiliations of {target}.
Look for connections between the data points, such as cross-referencing usernames across platforms, matching email addresses with possible profiles, and identifying recurring websites.
You are capable of complex reasoning and reflection, so do your best to extract all meaningful data about {target} from the osind.json file.
Add a summary with conclusions and highlights about {target} based on your analysis and reasoning.
